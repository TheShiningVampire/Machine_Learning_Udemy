Sale Price Prediction of Bulldozers using Machine learning:
1)Invoked the Random forest regression technique for prediction of the sale price using Scikit-Learn
2)Used RandomizedSearchCV to improve the efficiency of the model by tuning the hyperparameters
3)Determined the attributes of data which were most important in the prediction using Feature Importance
4)Used Root Mean Square Log Error(RMSLE) as the evaluation metric

Classification of Heart DiseaseInvoked machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifiers, Linear Regres-
sion using Scikit-Learn and used them to classify whether a person has a heart disease or not:
1)Plotted Receiver Operating Characteristics and Correlation Matrix using Matplotlib and Seaborn
2)Calculated various cross validated metrices such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score
3)Used GridSearchCV to tune the hyperparameters and K-Fold Cross Validation to avoid over-fitting
